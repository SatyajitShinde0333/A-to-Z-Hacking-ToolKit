### ARM32 Code

```assembly
.global _start

_start:
    mov r7, #0x30        @ Move hex 30 into r7
    b no_return          @ Branch to no_return function

no_return:
    mov r7, #1           @ Move decimal 1 into r7
    bl my_function       @ Call my_function; return address is stored in LR (r14)
                         @ After execution, it will return to wrap_up

wrap_up:
    mov r7, #0x12        @ Move hex 12 into r7
    b exit               @ Branch to exit

my_function:
    mov r0, #10          @ Move decimal 10 into r0
    bx lr                @ Return to the address stored in LR (r14)
                         @ This will return to wrap_up

exit:
    mov r7, #1           @ syscall: exit (1 is the syscall number for exit on ARM32)
    mov r0, #0           @ Exit code 0
    svc 0                @ Make the system call
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **`_start`**:
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - The program moves the value `0x30` into register `r7`.
   - It then branches to the `no_return` function.

2. **`no_return`**:
   - The program moves the value `1` into register `r7`.
   - The `bl my_function` instruction calls the `my_function` function. The return address (address of the next instruction) is stored in the Link Register (`LR`, which is `r14` in ARM32).

3. **`wrap_up`**:
   - After returning from `my_function`, the program moves the value `0x12` into register `r7`.
   - It then branches to the `exit` label.

4. **`my_function`**:
   - The function moves the value `10` into register `r0`.
   - The `bx lr` instruction returns to the address stored in the Link Register (`LR`, `r14`), which is the address of the instruction after the `bl` in `no_return`.

5. **`exit`**:
   - The program sets up the exit syscall by moving `1` (syscall number for exit) into `r7` and `0` (exit code) into `r0`.
   - The `svc 0` instruction makes the system call to exit the program.

### Compiling and Running the Code

1. **Save the code**:
   - Save the code in a file named `lr_demo_arm32.s`.

2. **Compile the code**:
   - Use the `arm-linux-gnueabi-as` assembler to assemble the code and `arm-linux-gnueabi-ld` to link it.
   ```bash
   arm-linux-gnueabi-as -o lr_demo_arm32.o lr_demo_arm32.s
   arm-linux-gnueabi-ld -o lr_demo_arm32 lr_demo_arm32.o
   ```

3. **Run the code**:
   - If you have an ARM32 environment (e.g., using QEMU), you can run the executable.
   ```bash
   qemu-arm ./lr_demo_arm32
   ```

4. **Debug with GDB**:
   - To debug the program using GDB, you can use `arm-linux-gnueabi-gdb`.
   ```bash
   arm-linux-gnueabi-gdb ./lr_demo_arm32
   ```
   - In GDB, you can set breakpoints, step through the code, and inspect registers.
   ```gdb
   (gdb) break _start
   (gdb) run
   (gdb) stepi
   (gdb) info registers
   ```

### Key Differences Between ARM32 and ARM64

1. **Registers**:
   - In ARM32, the Link Register is `r14` (LR), whereas in ARM64, it is `x30`.
   - ARM32 uses `r0-r12` for general-purpose registers, while ARM64 uses `x0-x30`.

2. **Return Instruction**:
   - In ARM32, `bx lr` is used to return from a function, whereas in ARM64, `ret` is used.

3. **Syscall Numbers**:
   - The syscall numbers differ between ARM32 and ARM64. For example, the exit syscall is `1` in ARM32 and `93` in ARM64.
