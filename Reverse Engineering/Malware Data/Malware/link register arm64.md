The Link Register (LR) in ARM64 architecture is a special-purpose register (register `X30`) used to store the return address for function calls. When a function is called using the `BL` (Branch with Link) instruction, the return address (the address of the next instruction after the `BL`) is stored in the LR. After the function completes, the program can return to the caller by branching to the address stored in the LR.

A simple ARM64 assembly code demo to illustrate how the Link Register works:

### ARM64 Assembly Code Example

```assembly
.global _start

_start:
    // Main program starts here
    MOV X0, #1          // Load value 1 into register X0
    MOV X1, #2          // Load value 2 into register X1
    BL add_numbers      // Call the function 'add_numbers'
                        // The return address (next instruction) is stored in LR (X30)

    // After returning from the function
    B end_program       // Branch to end_program to exit

add_numbers:
    // Function to add two numbers
    ADD X0, X0, X1      // Add X0 and X1, result in X0
    RET                 // Return to the address stored in LR (X30)

end_program:
    // End of program
    MOV X0, #0          // Set return value to 0
    MOV X8, #93         // syscall: exit
    SVC #0              // Make the system call
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **`_start`**:
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - The program loads values `1` and `2` into registers `X0` and `X1`, respectively.
   - The `BL add_numbers` instruction calls the `add_numbers` function. The address of the next instruction (after `BL`) is stored in the Link Register (`X30`).

2. **`add_numbers`**:
   - This function adds the values in `X0` and `X1` and stores the result in `X0`.
   - The `RET` instruction branches to the address stored in the Link Register (`X30`), effectively returning control to the caller.

3. **`end_program`**:
   - After returning from the function, the program branches to `end_program`.
   - The program sets the return value to `0` and makes a system call to exit.

### How the Link Register Works

- When `BL add_numbers` is executed:
  - The address of the next instruction (after `BL`) is saved in the Link Register (`X30`).
  - The program counter (`PC`) is updated to the address of `add_numbers`.

- When `RET` is executed:
  - The program counter (`PC`) is set to the value stored in the Link Register (`X30`), which is the return address.
  - This allows the program to continue execution from where the function was called.

### Key Points

- The Link Register (`X30`) is used to store the return address for function calls.
- The `BL` instruction automatically saves the return address in `X30`.
- The `RET` instruction uses the value in `X30` to return to the caller.
